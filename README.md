The program converts a grayscale image representation from int-based to float-based using C and x86 Assembly language. When running the program, the user is prompted with the option of either inputting their own image sizes and values, or randomizing the inputs for either a 10x10, 100x100, or 1000x1000 image.

The outputs of C and Assembly are checked for correctness by the following code:

### I. Execution Time and Short Analysis of the Performance
- At every run, the functions for converting int to float for C and Assembly are looped 30 times, the run times for these are tallied up and the averages are calculated. The following are the average run times for C and Assembly when given: A. a 10x10 input image size, B. a 100x100 input image size, and C. a 1000x1000 input image size.
  
- (Note: Output pixel values are not shown for 100x100 and 1000x1000 inputs since the results are too large and convoluted to show, however, the output of the previously mentioned output checker will be shown.)
